# NicerApp
this is a revolutionary and constantly evolving, well-maintained repository of HTML, CSS, JS and PHP code with which you can build websites that use a tiled image, photo or youtube video as site background for information and apps that are put over that background in a semi-transparent way.

# Installation
Nicerapp can be run on windows, linux and macOS systems, possibly even on smartphones,
and all it requires is a webserver that can serve up PHP scripts,
and the **couchdb database server[0]** which works with **JSON data**.

However, it can be augmented with a **SQL server** like mysql[1] **which puts data in tables, rows and columns**.

[0] see https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/index.html

[1] see https://adodb.org

The default database for nicerapp is couchdb. I find it more flexible and a lot easier to use than SQL data.

One guiding principle of developing web-apps with nicerapp is that we shield our database servers from the outside world as much as possible.
This means all requests for data by the browsers go via the **browser's jQuery.com** (.../nicerapp_v2/nicerapp/3rd-party/jQuery) **AJAX** (asynchronous javascript and XML) code to PHP scripts that are all specific to the requested functionality, and from there forth and back to the actual database server (from **PHP**, which does all of the error checking and **reports back only FAILED or SUCCESS (or the requested data)** in non-debug-mode **to the browser**).

The couchdb server software and it's instructions can be found on https://couchdb.apache.org

On windows, the https://wampserver.com/en WAMP stack (windows, apache, mysql, php) is well-suited, 
and it can also be done on **linux systems[2]** from the **terminal** OS-level app, as such :

[2] if you have no linux system yet, know that a core-i5 with a modest amount of RAM and SSD space runs the latest version just fine, and i recommend to install https://ubuntu.com or kubuntu in case you want semi-transparent windows in your OS

# installing the nicerapp source files
make a folder equivalent to /home/rene/data1/htdocs/nicerapp_v2 
    meaning : use your own ubuntu username and possibly the name of your 
    domain (internet site) instead of localhost. 
    localhost is usually used for development setups, 
    and should ideally be run on a different machine than 
    your live server that hosts your domain.


put the nicerapp source files in that folder :

> cd /home/rene/data1/htdocs
>
> git clone https://github.com/nicerapp/nicerapp_v2
> 
> cd /home/rene/data1/htdocs/nicerapp_v2/nicerapp/3rd-party/jQuery
> 
> git clone https://github.com/bgrins/spectrum
> 
> cd ..
> 
> git clone https://github.com/zingchart/zingtouch
> 
> cd /home/rene/data1/htdocs/nicerapp_v2


copy the following into /etc/apache2/sites-available/001.localhost.conf 
(everything between the /---- lines)
(be sure to modify ServerAdmin and DocumentRoot in both places (mid-way through the text and at the bottom in <Directory>))
(this particular server is running on the unencrypted port 80, port 443 is the encrypted SSL port but it requires more configuration effort, see the manuals for **letsencrypt** and **certbot** and the example further down on this page you're reading now)

````
/----
<VirtualHost:80>
	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
	ServerName localhost

	ServerAdmin rene.veerman.netherlands@gmail.com
	DocumentRoot /home/rene/data1/htdocs/localhost

	# Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
	# error, crit, alert, emerg.
	# It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
	# modules, e.g.
	#LogLevel info ssl:warn

	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.localhost.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.localhost.log combined

	# For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
	# enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
	# include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
	# following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
	# after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
	#Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
	<Directory /home/rene/data1/htdocs/localhost>
		AllowOverride All
		Require all granted
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>
/----
````

after that, you can enable the site with :

>sudo a2ensite 001-localhost.conf
>sudo service apache2 restart

and launch your web-browser to http://localhost

# Adding background image files
The backgrounds are stored under 
.../nicerapp/siteMedia/backgrounds/landscape, 
.../nicerapp/siteMedia/backgrounds/tiled, 
and .../nicerapp/siteMedia/backgrounds/iframe/youtube (as *.txt files containing only one youtube video URL each)

These backgrounds are not included with the distribution of nicerapp, otherwise i'd run out of storage space on github.

# serving the site from an encrypted setup using HTTPS:// (SSL)
	
> sudo apt install nginx letsencrypt certbot
	
https://nginx.com is a gateway server, which you can put in front of your webserver software and database servers.
We need it to serve database connections over SSL connections, and to be able to serve multiple domain names (nicer.app, zoned.at, said.by, etc) from just one outgoing aka public IP address.

Next : put the following code snippet as a template in **/etc/nginx/sites-available/00-default-ssl.conf**
After that : 
> ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/na-default-ssl.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/na-default-ssl.conf

**don't forget : you need to tell apache to run on the right ports, 
which are 444, 447 and 448 in this example case, 
and those ports should NOT be forwarded from your modem / ADSL router / fiber internet connection device to your LAN. 
port 80 should be disabled in **all** /etc/apache2/sites-available/*.* entries**

**Finally**, you need to create the actual encryption keys. 
This is free and fairly simple.
You can choose between **certbot** or **letsencrypt**.
You can find tutorials on how to use them via google searches for either 'certbox example' or 'letsencrypt example'.

	
# Modifying the HTML for a nicerapp site
This is done by modifying .../nicerapp/domainConfigs/YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME/index.template.php
and .../nicerapp/domainConfigs/YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME/desktop.source.js

# Adding new URLs and apps into a nicerapp site
All apps and pages on a nicerapp site are loaded through a URL that looks somewhat like this :
http://localhost/apps/eyJtdXNpYyI6eyJzZXQiOiJpbmRleCJ9fQ

You will notice the "strange" sequence after /apps/ in that URL.
It's strange because it's base64-encoded JSON, allowing for multiple settings to be passed into the nicerapp PHP code, while avoiding the "old" practice of using http://localhost/apps/someApp.php?setting1=x&setting2=y

If you want to simplify things for use in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), you can have http://localhost/abc automatically translated into http://localhost/apps/eyJtdXNpYyI6eyJzZXQiOiJpbmRleCJ9fQ in **.../.htaccess** - there are already some examples supplied.

You would store any new apps that you might create under .../nicerapp/apps/YOURNAME/APPNAME/app.dialog.siteContent.php or .../nicerapp/apps/YOURNAME/APPNAME/app.dialog.siteToolbarLeft.php or any other main DIV name with class="vividDialog" as found in .../nicerapp/domainConfigs/YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME/index.template.php

And .../ajax_get_content.php is responsible for mapping your http://localhost/apps/eyJtdXNpYyI6eyJzZXQiOiJpbmRleCJ9fQ to the right code.

One would ask, rightfully so, how to create these /apps/* URLs.
in PHP, that's done with the always available .../nicerapp/functions.php::**base64_encode_url()** and .../nicerapp/functions.php::**base64_decode_url()**
in JavaScript, it's done with the always available **na.m.base64_encode_url()** and **na.m.base64_decode_url()**

# Questions, bug-reports, feature-requests?

you can post these to rv.nicer.app@gmail.com, and i will try to respond within 72 hours, even on weekends.

if you need a quick solution towards getting yourself a collection of background images, you can look for 'wallpaper' on https://rarbg.to and use a torrent client (like transmission on ubuntu, or utorrent on windows) to download them.

i will consider making the 15GB of photos and tiled images that is currently served on https://nicer.app available on https://rarbg.to
