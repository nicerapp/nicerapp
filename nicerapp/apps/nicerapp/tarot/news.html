I request that <span style="font-size:130%; font-weight:bold">if you find any bugs in this free web game then please <a href="mailto:fancywebapps@xs4all.nl">let me know by e-mail</a></span>, try to be descriptive in your report of what went wrong for which deck and which reading. Please start the subject of your e-mail with "bugreport tarot"<br/>
</p>

<p>
I'd also like to extend <span style="color:lime;font-size:130%;">an offer to all tarot experts out there</span>; <a href="mailto:fancywebapps@xs4all.nl">Please e-mail me</a> if you are interested to host _your own_ tarot card descriptions and reading descriptions on this site, in exchange for a fair share of the profits. Below you'll find a draft for a profit-sharing contract.
</p>

<p>
I will also honor takedown requests from all owners of Intellectual Property who do not want to sign the profit sharing contract. Of course, you would need to prove that you are the legitimate owner of such Intellectual Property.<br/>
