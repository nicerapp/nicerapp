<h1><span style="color:red;background:white;">BlessedTarot Profit Sharing Contract</span></h1>

<p>
	This is a contract between the creator and owner of the website BlessedTarot, and the holder of Copyright or Intellectual Property rights for artwork and text ("IP holder") found on the website BlessedTarot.info<br/>
	The URLs for BlessedTarot are:
	<ul>
		<li>"live site" : http://BlessedTarot.com</li>
	</ul>
	This contract is made under Dutch law, because [the owner of BlessedTarot.com] lives in The Netherlands.<br/>
</p>

<p>
The Intellectual Property found on BlessedTarot can be divided into 2 categories; "Decks" and "Descriptions".<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Decks are the entire set of artwork that makes up a Tarot card set, and for which the URL starts with http://BlessedTarot.com/decks/ or http://skatescene.biz/sites/BlessedTarot.com/decks/, and ends with: .jpg</li>
	<li>Descriptions are the entire set of text that describes the cards 0 through 77 in a Tarot card deck, and all the reading types offered on BlessedTarot. Currently only 1 Description set is used, written by [the owner of BlessedTarot.com].</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In return for allowing [the owner of BlessedTarot.com] to host and use their Intellectual Property on BlessedTarot, the IP holder will receive a share of profits, that is determined as follows;<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Of the entire annual profits of BlessedTarot, a 50% share is reserved for IP holders other than [the owner of BlessedTarot.com]. This 50% share is then divided as follows;
		<ul>
			<li>25% of total annual profits is divided into "deck play shares" by the number of Tarot games played on BlessedTarot, but only those games that played decks that IP holders other than [the owner of BlessedTarot.com] have signed this contract for ("signed decks").<br/>
			For each signed deck, the number of times that deck has been played determines how many "deck play shares" are paid out to the IP holder of that deck.
			</li>
			<li>25% of total annual profits is reserved for IP holders other than [the owner of BlessedTarot.com] who have signed this contract, that hold the copyrights to Descriptions.<br/>
			This share is once again divided (into "description play shares") by the number of Tarot games played on BlessedTarot for which the descriptions come from an IP holder that has signed this contract.<br/>
			The IP holder for any description will receive as many description play shares as there were Tarot games played on BlessedTarot using descriptions owned by the IP holder.<br/>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Profits of BlessedTarot are calculated from January 1st up to and including December 31st, paid out no later than February 1st.</li>
	<li>Once an IP holder is signed, he/she/they will receive profits of the entire calendar year in which they first applied to sign on, as per terms stipulated in the previous bullet item.</li>
	<li>If no decks have signed IP holders, then the entire 50% share of annual profits of BlessedTarot is awarded to IP holders of descriptions, per the same division as is described above for half that amount.</li>
	<li>If no descriptions have signed IP holders, then the entire 50% share of annual profits of BlessedTarot is awarded to IP holders of decks, per the same division as is described above for half that amount.</li>
	<li>If no decks and no descriptions have signed IP holders by January 1st, [the owner of BlessedTarot.com] can keep the entire profits for the previous year.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Signed IP holders will be provided with as much digital proof as is humanly possible by [the owner of BlessedTarot.com] to calculate the actual play counts and what-was-played on BlessedTarot.
</p>

<p>
Signed IP holders have the right to request read-only FTP access to both the development site section for BlessedTarot, and for it's live site.<br/>
Before receiving such access, they must first physically sign and mail a non-disclosure agreement that gives 1 technical expert from the IP holder's Company or 1 technical expert hired by the IP holder (if not signed on behalf of a Company), or the IP holder signer him/herself, the right to view the files that make up BlessedTarot. At no time is the IP holder or technical expert allowed to make, keep or any any way use a copy of any of the files that make up BlessedTarot, other than to determine if the statistics [the owner of BlessedTarot.com] reports are accurate.
</p>

<p>
IP holders are allowed and encouraged to promote their own Decks and Descriptions by advertising the proper URL (only under http://BlessedTarot.com/ please, as that is the live, non-experimentation version of the site).
</p>
