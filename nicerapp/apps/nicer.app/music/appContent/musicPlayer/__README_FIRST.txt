BANDWIDTH CONSUMPTION : ABOUT 30KB/sec/listener.

musicPlayer at my current 2MB/sec outgoing bandwidth speed and getting a listener for one of my mixes (a mix of 2 hours worth 200MB in mp3 format).

2 hours = 120 minutes = 120 * 60 = 7200 seconds

7200 seconds, 2MB/sec outgoing bandwidth, 200MB total per listener of 2 hour music mp3 mix

that is per second : 200/7200 = 0,027777778 MB/sec = 27.777778kb/sec

percentage of line speed is : 0,027777778/2 = 0,0138889% of line speed
